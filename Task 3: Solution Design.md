###  1.Define Key Metrics & Hypothesis
Hypothesis:
- Null Hypothesis (H₀): Mandating 4 leads per job does not result in higher lead utilisation.
- Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): Mandating 4 leads per job increases lead utilisation.

### 2. Metrics
Primary Metrics (Key Success Measures): Lead Utilisation Rate = (Leads Accepted / Leads Offered)

Tradie Engagement Rate = Percentage of tradies who claim at least one lead
Time to Job Acceptance = Time taken for a job to be claimed
Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) Score = Impact on customer experience

###  3. Determine Experiment Design & Sample Size
- A/B Testing Type: Frequentist approach (Classical Hypothesis Testing) or Bayesian approach
- Randomisation Strategy:
  - Jobs are randomly assigned to either control (3 leads per job) or treatment (4 leads per job)
  - Stratified randomisation may be used to balance by job category, location, and time of posting
- Power Analysis
- Use historical data to determine baseline metrics and calculate the minimum detectable effect (MDE)
- Sample size require Set confidence level = 95% and power = 80%
